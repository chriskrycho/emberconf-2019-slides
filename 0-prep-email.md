Hello, everyone! I’m looking forward to seeing you and working on TypeScript in Ember.js together in a week!

To make the workshop go as smoothly as possible and avoid as many hiccups as we can (especially given conference WiFi is notoriously spotty), I have two requests for some ahead-of-time setup:

1. Clone the app and install the dependencies.
2. Set up your editor.

I am *not* allotting time for these tasks during the workshop: we have way too much to get through!

Here are the details you need:

## Task 1: Clone the app and install the dependencies

On Saturday (March 16), Sunday (March 17), or Monday morning (March 18), please download [the code for the workshop](https://github.com/chriskrycho/emberconf-2019)! (Why not till Saturday? Because I’m still putting the final touches on it this week!)

On the command line:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/chriskrycho/emberconf-2019.git
$ cd emberconf
$ git checkout setup
$ yarn install
```

Make sure you check out the `setup` branch before doing `yarn install`!

## Task 2: Set up your editor

You’ll also want your editor configured with TypeScript support. You should follow the setup instructions provided for your editor on the [Official TypeScript Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support). I have managed to get them going fairly well following the links there even for the editors I don’t use myself, so thing *should* be pretty smooth for you, assuming you already know how to set up plugins in your editor or IDE of choice.

For VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Sublime Text, there are project files you can open directly in the root of the Git repository. The VS Code project file will also prompt you to install a set of helpful addons for doing Ember.js development.

Note that I’m not familiar enough with the setups for Vim or Emacs to be much help there, but I know that people throughout the community have used each of Atom, VS Code, Sublime Text, and the JetBrains IDEs enough to help a little if something weird comes up during the course of the workshop.

## See you soon!

That’s it! Have the project and its dependencies set up and an editor ready, and you’ll be ready to go. Looking forward to seeing all of you next week!
